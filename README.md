# web-scraper

This project is part of a bigger project, namely the ** "Interview Buddy" **

This project scrapes off the *puzzles* section from geeksforgeeks section of interview preparation

The *"get-questions-link.py"* file scrapes off links for questions, and writes it to the *"question-links.txt"*

This is followed by execution of the *"create-database.py"*, which writes the required data to a csv-file, namely *"DataBase.csv"*
